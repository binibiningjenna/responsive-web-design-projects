# 🎨 Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains all the projects I built while completing the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

The repo is organized into two sections:
- ✅ **Certification Projects** – required to earn the certificate
- 🧪 **Practice Projects** – bonus exercises from lessons to build HTML/CSS skills

---

## ✅ Certification Projects

These are the 5 projects submitted to earn the certification:

| Project | Folder |
|--------|--------|
| 🏛️ Tribute Page | `/certification-projects/tribute-page` |
| 📋 Survey Form | `/certification-projects/survey-form` |
| 🛍️ Product Landing Page | `/certification-projects/product-landing-page` |
| 📚 Technical Documentation Page | `/certification-projects/technical-doc-page` |
| 💼 Personal Portfolio Webpage | `/certification-projects/personal-portfolio` |

Each folder contains the HTML and CSS files for that project.

---

## 🧪 Practice Projects

These are hands-on HTML/CSS mini projects completed while going through the curriculum. While not required for certification, they helped reinforce layout, design, and semantic HTML concepts.
