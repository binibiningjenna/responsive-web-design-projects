# 🎨 Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains all the projects I built while completing the [freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/).

The repo is organized into two sections:
- ✅ **Certification Projects** – required to earn the certificate
- 🧪 **Practice Projects** – bonus exercises from lessons to build HTML/CSS skills

---

## ✅ Certification Projects

These are the 5 projects submitted to earn the certification:

## 🧪 Practice Projects

These are hands-on HTML/CSS mini projects completed while going through the curriculum. While not required for certification, they helped reinforce layout, design, and semantic HTML concepts.
